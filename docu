8 Centrally Sponsored Schemes Delinked from Support of the Centre

24 Schemes to be run with the Changed Sharing Pattern while 31 Schemes will Get Full Support of the Centre

The plan outlay of 2015-16 reflects the compositional shift in the allocations for various Programmes and Schemes in view of high devolution; 42% of Union Taxes, to States as per the recommendation of 14th Finance Commission. Making his Budget Speech while presenting the General Budget 2015-16, the Finance Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley said that consequent to this substantially higher devolution, many schemes on the State subjects are to be delinked from Central support.  However, keeping in mind that some of these schemes represent national priorities especially those targeted at poverty alleviation, Centre has decided that it will continue to contribute to such schemes, the Minister added.  Besides, the schemes mandated by legal obligations and those backed by Cess collection have been fully provided for.

 

As per the Budget 2015-16, centre has decided to support fully which are targeted to the benefits of socially disadvantaged group.  In case of some Centrally Sponsored Schemes, the Centre: State funding pattern will undergo a change with States to contribute higher share.  Details of changes in sharing pattern will have to be worked out by administrative Ministry/Department.  The details of Plan outlays in 2015-16 are to be seen against this backdrop.

 

In the General Budget 2015-16, there are 31 Schemes to be fully sponsored by the Union Government, 8 Schemes have been delinked from support of the Centre and 24 Schemes will now be run with the changed sharing pattern.   

 

To enhance public spending in the economy, Government has significantly enhanced the capital expenditure despite fiscal pressure.  In comparison to capital spending of Rs. 192378 crore in RE 2014-15, the capital spending will be Rs. 241431 crore in 2015-16.  This will be a growth of 25.5 per cent.
